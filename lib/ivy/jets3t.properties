## Common S3Service communication properties

# s3service.https-only=true
# If true, all communication with S3 will be via encrypted HTTPS connections,
# otherwise communications will be sent unencrypted via HTTP
# Default: true

# s3service.max-thread-count=4
# The maximum number of concurrent communication threads that will be started
# by the multi-threaded service for upload and download operations.
# Note: This value should not exceed the maximum number of connections
# available, such as is set by the property httpclient.max-connections
# Default: 4

# s3service.admin-max-thread-count=10
# The maximum number of concurrent communication threads that will be started
# by the multi-threaded service for administrative operations such as DELETE
# and HEAD requests. Because these operations are short-lived and incur little
# bandwidth, most systems can reliably use many more administrative threads
# than upload/download threads.
# Note: This value should not exceed the maximum number of connections
# available, such as is set by the property httpclient.max-connections
# Default: 10

# s3service.stream-retry-buffer-size=131072
# How many bytes to buffer for use when retrying failed transmissions. This
# value must be small enough that applications using multiple upload threads
# will not exceed their available memory by buffering data
# Note: Applies only to InputStream-based uploads, not uploads based on files
# Default: 131072

# s3service.internal-error-retry-max=5
# The maximum number of times each connection that fails with S3
# InternalServer errors will be retried. To disable retries of InternalError
# failures set this to 0.
# Note: After each failure the service waits before retrying. The time to wait
# is calculated with the formula:
# 50 * (internalErrorCount ^ 2)
# Default: 5

# s3service.default-bucket-location=US
# The location in which buckets will be created by default. This value may be
# US or EU.
# Default: US

# s3service.s3-endpoint=s3.amazonaws.com
# The host name of the S3 service. You should only ever change this value from
# the default if you need to contact an alternative S3 endpoint for testing
# purposes.
# Default: s3.amazonaws.com

# s3service.disable-dns-buckets=false
# By default, JetS3t will always incorporate bucket names that are
# DNS-compatible into the host name of its requests. For example, a request
# addressing the bucket "mybucket" will be sent to the host name
# "mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com". If you set this property to true, JetS3t will
# put bucket names in the request's path instead of its host name, for example
# "s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket". This behaviour may be useful for testing
# purposes, or if DNS problems prevent the default host name addressing format
# from working correctly.
# Note: If you set this property to true, you will be unable to access buckets
# located in the EU.
# Default: false

# s3service.ignore-exceptions-in-multi=false
# If this value is set to true, JetS3t will ignore exceptions that occur
# during multi-threaded operations performed by the S3ServiceMulti class. This
# option should only be used as a last resort when you need to complete an
# upload or download operation despite many communication errors.
# Default: false


## REST/HTTP HttpClient Implementation properties

# httpclient.connection-timeout-ms=60000
# How many milliseconds to wait before a connection times out. 0 means
# infinity.
# Default: 60000

# httpclient.socket-timeout-ms=60000
# How many milliseconds to wait before a socket connection times out. 0 means
# infinity.
# Default: 60000

# httpclient.max-connections=10
# The maximum number of simultaneous connections to allow
# Note: Be careful increasing this from the default value, as communications
# errors can result if it is set too high for your system/connection/usage
# scenarios
# Default: 10

# httpclient.stale-checking-enabled=true
# "Determines whether stale connection check is to be used. Disabling stale
# connection check may result in slight performance improvement at the risk of
# getting an I/O error when executing a request over a connection that has
# been closed at the server side."
# Default: true

# httpclient.retry-max=5
# How many times to retry connections when they fail with IO errors. Set this
# to 0 to disable retries.
# Default: 5

# httpclient.useragent=Application-specific
# The user agent string sent with HTTP requests.
# Default: Application-specific

# httpclient.read-throttle=
# Imposes a rudimentary limit on the bandwidth used for uploads by throttling
# the speed at which data will be sent to S3. This property specifies the
# limit in KB/s, specified as an integer.
# Default: N/A (This property is commented-out by default)

# httpclient.proxy-autodetect=true
# Indicates that JetS3t should auto-detect the HTTP proxy settings appropriate
# for the local machine.
# Default: true

# httpclient.proxy-host=
# Explicitly sets the host name of a HTTP proxy server. To apply this setting,
# proxy autodetection should be disabled by setting
# httpclient.proxy-autodetect to false.
# Default: N/A (This property is commented-out by default)

# httpclient.proxy-port=
# Explicitly sets the port number of a HTTP proxy server. To apply this
# setting, proxy autodetection should be disabled by setting
# httpclient.proxy-autodetect to false.
# Default: N/A (This property is commented-out by default)

# httpclient.socket-receive-buffer=
# Integer value for the TCP receive window size in bytes, which is provided as
# a hint to the kernel by the HttpClient library before HTTP socket
# connections are established. This value will not necessarily override a
# kernel's default TCP window size settings because the kernel is free to
# ignore the hint.
# Default: N/A (This property is commented-out by default, in which case the
# default TCP window size will be used)

# httpclient.socket-send-buffer=
# Integer value for the TCP receive window size in bytes, which is provided as
# a hint to the kernel by the HttpClient library before HTTP socket
# connections are established. This value will not necessarily override a
# kernel's default TCP window size settings because the kernel is free to
# ignore the hint.
# Default: N/A (This property is commented-out by default, in which case the
# default TCP window size will be used)


## File Upload properties

# uploads.storeEmptyDirectories=true
# Boolean value that indicates whether JetS3t applications that upload files
# to S3 should create place-holder objects to represent directories.
# Place-holder objects are named after a directory, have no data content and
# have the mimetype application/x-directory. If this option is set to false,
# synchronization from a local filesystem and S3 will not include empty
# directories.
# Default: true

# filecomparer.ignore-panic-dir-placeholders=
# Boolean value that indicates whether JetS3t applications that synchronize
# files with S3 should ignore directory place-holder objects created by the
# Transmit application provided by Panic.
# Default: N/A (This property is commented-out by default)

# filecomparer.use-md5-files=
# Boolean value that indicates whether JetS3t applications that synchronize
# files with S3 should look for files containing pre-generated MD5 hash
# values. These MD5 files must be named after the file they refer to, eg
# <filename>.md5, and must contain a hex-encoded MD5 value. If one of these
# files is present, JetS3t will use the pre-generated hash value rather than
# calculating a new hash - potentially saving a great deal of time when you
# are synchronizing large files. If the pre-generated MD5 file is older than
# the file it refers to, a new hash value will be calculated.
# Default: N/A (This property is commented-out by default)

# filecomparer.generate-md5-files=
# Boolean value that indicates whether JetS3t applications that synchronize
# files with S3 should create <filename>.md5 files to store the MD5 hash
# values they calculate. If these values are stored, they need not be
# recalculated in future synchronizations. This property is intended to be
# used in conjunction with filecomparer.use-md5-files.
# Default: N/A (This property is commented-out by default)

# filecomparer.skip-upload-of-md5-files=
# Boolean value that indicates whether JetS3t applications that synchronize
# files with S3 should avoid uploading <filename>.md5 files to S3. This
# property is intended to be used in conjunction with
# filecomparer.use-md5-files.
# Default: N/A (This property is commented-out by default)


## File Download properties

# downloads.restoreLastModifiedDate=false
# Boolean value that indicates whether JetS3t applications that download files
# from S3 should restore the original last modified date of the file,
# according to the value of the metadata item
# "jets3t-original-file-date-iso8601" created by JetS3t tools that upload
# files. If this property is set to true, it will be possible to retain a
# file's last modified date when that file is downloaded or restored form S3.
# Default: false


## Encryption properties

# crypto.algorithm=PBEWithMD5AndDES
# Name of the PBE cryptographic algorithm to used by JetS3t applications that
# encrypt items uploaded to S3.
# Note: The default algorithm isn't a strong one, and should be improved if
# security is important
# Note 2: The algorithms available will depend on the cryptography provider
# libraries installed on a system, and the Java policy file settings. This is
# a complicated topic that is not specific to JetS3t, please refer to
# documentation elsewhere.
# Default: PBEWithMD5AndDES

## GUI properties

# gui.verboseErrorDialog=true
# If true, JetS3t applications that display error dialogs will include more
# information about errors.
# Default: true
